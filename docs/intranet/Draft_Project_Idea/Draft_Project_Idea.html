<h1>Project Idea - The AI School</h1>
<h2>An education platform for individual learning with an AI tutor</h2>
<ul><li>The platform analyses your preferences and suggests subjects that you may be interested in</li>
<li>Using our custom AI, students get learning program that go at their own pace</li>
<li>3rd party education providers (uni, tafe, private college, music schools) can load their material into our servers for delivery to the customer</li>
<li>The AI is the most patient teacher ever!</li>
<li>The AI takes the learning outside. Field trips to collect samples for subjects like botany, biology. The AI knows where samples are likely to be found.</li>
<li>Base our Ai on <a href="https://github.com/openai">OpenAI?</a></li>
<li>How can we better incorporate location awareness?</li>
<li>Deploy on Android and iOS. Anything else?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd appreciate some input from the team for the project idea regarding machine learning and location awareness</p>
